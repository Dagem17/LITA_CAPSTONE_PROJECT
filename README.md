### Key Insights

- Top-Selling Products: Shoes, Shirts and Hats contribute the highest revenue, indicating strong demand.
- Regional Performance: The south region generates the highest sales, indicating a strong customer base. This suggests that marketing efforts should focus on retaining these customers while exploring opportunities to grow in underperforming regions like the North and West.
- Seasonal Trends: Sales peak in February and July, likely due to holiday and mid-year shopping trends. To capitalize on this, the business should launch targeted promotions and optimize inventory levels ahead of these months.
