### Key Insights
---

- Popular Subscription Types: Basic subscriptions account for 49.9% of total revenue, making them a primary focus for customer acquisition and retention.
- Regional Trends: All regions have an equal number of customers, but canacellation rates vary, requiring tailored retention strategies.
-  Cancellation Patterns: Higher cancellation rates occur

The analysis showed that regions have the same number of customers, and the most popular subscription type is Basic. The revenue is largely driven by the Basic Subscription, contributing 49.90% of total revenue. Maintaining and expanding this subscription type while exploring options to grow lesser-performing types may enhance revenue diversification and stability. Leveraging these insights can guide future campaign planning.
