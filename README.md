### Data Analysis

1. Customer Segmentation :Understanding who the customers are by region and subscription type.
- Provide insight into the customer base by breaking down segments such as region and subscription type.
- Donut Chart: Show the breakdown of customers by SubscriptionType. It will help identify which subscription types are most popular. 
- Bar Chart: Shows the split of active vs. canceled customers by region. Decision-makers can use this to tailor marketing or support efforts to key regions.

2. Cancellation Analysis: Identify trends and patterns in subscription cancellations to improve customer retention.
- Line Chart: Display the trend of cancellations over time. 
This section provides clues as to which regions or subscription types face higher cancellation, helping the business focus retention efforts on high-churn segments or adjust offerings to improve retention.

3.  Revenue and Growth Trends: Where revenue is coming from and which subscription types contribute the most to business growth.
- Column Chart: Display total revenue by SubscriptionType, showing which types generate the most income.
- Line Chart: Track revenue growth over time, using SubscriptionStart as the X-axis and the sum of Revenue as the Y-axis to observe revenue trends.
Which subscriptions drive the most revenue and how revenue has grown over time. These patterns can guide pricing strategy, subscription offerings, and long-term planning.

Various slicers were added:
1. Region Slicer: Filter by Region to see regional performance.
2. Subscription Type Slicer: Filtering by SubscriptionType to view data for specific offerings.
3. Canceled Status Slicer: Filter by subscription canceled (False or True) to analyze data separately for active and canceled customers.
4. Date Range Slicer: Provide a slicer for SubscriptionStart or SubscriptionEnd to filter the analysis over a custom date range.

The analysis showed that regions have the same number of customers, and the most popular subscription type is Basic. The revenue is largely driven by the Basic Subscription, contributing 49.90% of total revenue. Maintaining and expanding this subscription type while exploring options to grow lesser-performing types may enhance revenue diversification and stability. Leveraging these insights can guide future campaign planning.
