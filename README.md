1. Sales Overview

Metrics to Display:

Total Revenue: A card visual showing the total revenue figure to give users an immediate understanding of sales magnitude.
Monthly Sales Trend: A line chart with a clear trend line showing month-over-month sales. This helps identify seasonal patterns and growth trends.
Average Sales per Product: Showcased in a table, this metric gives insight into the average revenue each product brings, helping to gauge product demand.


Narrative:

"Our total revenue for the year stands strong, with visible monthly sales growth indicating a positive trend. Seasonal spikes in certain months (e.g., holiday seasons or back-to-school) highlight key times for promotions."

2. Top Products – Understanding Demand

Metrics to Display:

Top Products by Sales Value: A bar chart sorted by total revenue helps quickly identify the top-performing products.
Product Sales Share: A donut chart showing each product’s contribution to the total sales percentage provides a clear picture of product performance distribution.
Highest-Selling Product Card: Highlighting the single top product with a card visual draws attention to the main revenue driver.

Narrative:

"Our top product categories are consistently driving the highest sales, with [Top Product] leading. This product accounts for a significant share of our total sales, underscoring the need to maintain inventory and consider expanding the product line based on customer interest."

3. Regional Breakdown – Targeting Markets

Metrics to Display:

Sales by Region: A map or pie chart showcasing each region’s sales contribution to visualize where demand is strongest.
Monthly Sales by Region: A line chart with separate lines for each region to show regional trends over time
Transactions by Region: A bar chart representing the number of transactions by region reveals customer engagement.


Narrative:

"The [Top Region] region contributes the highest sales, showing a strong customer base. However, other regions show growth potential, especially with targeted marketing. This data suggests that increased marketing efforts or product availability in high-growth regions could enhance revenue."


Customer Insights – Building Relationships

Metrics to Display:

Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase Amount: A bar chart with customer names and purchase totals highlights loyal, high-value customers.
Customer Sales Trends: If customer segments are available, a chart showing which segments are growing most rapidly can be insightful for targeted marketing.
Narrative:
"Our top customers represent significant value. Understanding their buying behavior and identifying similar customer segments could help in cultivating loyalty and increasing repeat purchases."



Conclusion

Summarize the data-driven insights discovered:

"The highest sales months suggest times to increase stock or offer promotions."

"The top-selling products are clear best-sellers that could benefit from upselling or cross-selling efforts."

"Regions with lower sales could be targeted with region-specific campaigns to drive engagement."

"Top customers represent a significant portion of sales, emphasizing the importance of a loyalty program or personalized offers."

![Customer Segmentation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/67483499-aeed-41ba-a648-cca2d9dd7f2f)


Step 1: 

1. Customer Segmentation: Understanding who the customers are by region and subscription type.
2. Cancellation Analysis: Exploring cancellation patterns to understand customer retention.
3. Revenue and Growth Trends: Examining revenue drivers and subscription trends over time.


Key metrics to highlight:

Total customers by region and subscription type
Active vs. canceled subscriptions
Revenue by subscription type and region
Average subscription duration
Trends in cancellations and revenue over time


Step 2: Design the Dashboard Layout for Storytelling
Divide the dashboard into logical sections, each representing a piece of the story, with clear, interactive visuals that let users explore each theme in detail.

Section 1: Customer Segmentation
Objective: Provide insight into the customer base by breaking down segments such as region and subscription type.

Visuals:

Donut Chart: Show the breakdown of customers by SubscriptionType (e.g., Basic, Premium, etc.).
Bar Chart: Show the split of active vs. canceled customers by region.

Insights: This section will help identify where the customer base is concentrated geographically and which subscription types are most popular. Decision-makers can use this to tailor marketing or support efforts to key regions.


Section 2: 

Objective: Identify trends and patterns in subscription cancellations to improve customer retention.

Visuals:

Clustered Bar Chart: Show cancellations by Region and SubscriptionType, with a focus on which segments have the highest churn rates.
Line Chart: Display the trend of cancellations over time. Plot SubscriptionEnd by month or quarter to identify peaks and dips in cancellations.
KPI Cards: Display key metrics, such as total active subscriptions, total cancellations, and churn rate (calculated as canceled subscriptions divided by total subscriptions).

Insights: This section provides clues as to which regions or subscription types face higher churn, helping the business focus retention efforts on high-churn segments or adjust offerings to improve retention.


Section 3: Revenue and Growth Trends

Objective: Show where revenue is coming from and which subscription types contribute the most to business growth.

Visuals:

Column Chart: Display total revenue by SubscriptionType, showing which types generate the most income.
Line Chart: Track revenue growth over time, using SubscriptionStart as the X-axis and the sum of Revenue as the Y-axis to observe revenue trends.
Scatter Plot: Show average subscription duration vs. revenue per customer to understand the relationship between customer loyalty and revenue. Each point represents a customer or a subscription type.

Insights: This section highlights which subscriptions drive the most revenue and how revenue has grown over time. Understanding these patterns can guide pricing strategy, subscription offerings, and long-term planning.

Step 3

1. Region Slicer: Allow users to filter by Region to see regional performance.
2. Subscription Type Slicer: Allow filtering by SubscriptionType to view data for specific offerings.
3. Status Slicer: Allow users to filter by subscription status (Active or Canceled) to analyze data separately for active and canceled customers.
4. Date Range Slicer: Provide a slicer for SubscriptionStart or SubscriptionEnd to filter the analysis over a custom date range.
These slicers make the dashboard interactive, enabling users to focus on specific segments, time periods, or types of subscriptions for more detailed insights.

Step 4:

1. Customer Concentration: "Our highest customer base is in the [Top Region] region, and the most popular subscription type is [Top Subscription Type]. This concentration suggests an opportunity to target similar demographics in nearby regions or tailor marketing strategies for popular segments."
2. Revenue Drivers: "Our revenue is largely driven by the [Top Revenue Subscription Type], contributing [Percentage]% of total revenue. Maintaining and expanding this subscription type while exploring options to grow lesser-performing types may enhance revenue diversification and stability."
3. Growth Trends: "The revenue growth trend shows seasonal peaks around [High Revenue Months or Quarters], indicating possible influences such as holiday periods or marketing campaigns. Leveraging these insights can guide future campaign planning."

Step 5: 

1. Titles and Labels: Use clear titles for each section and concise labels on visuals to make the insights easy to understand.
2. Annotations: Add text boxes with explanations or recommendations directly on the dashboard near key insights.
3. Tooltips and Drill-Throughs: Add tooltips to display additional metrics when hovering over visuals and enable drill-throughs for in-depth analysis of specific data points.
4. Consistent Color Scheme: Use a color scheme that visually separates active and canceled subscriptions (e.g., green for active, red for canceled) and reinforces brand colors.

Step 6: Test Interactivity and Present the Story

1. Use Slicers: Show how filtering by specific regions or subscription types can change the insights.
2. Walk through each section: Describe the insights derived from each part of the dashboard and how they support business decisions.
3. Highlight Key Insights for Strategy: Emphasize actionable insights, such as focusing on high-churn segments or capitalizing on top revenue drivers.
